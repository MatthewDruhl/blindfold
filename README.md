# Blindfold

A Claude Code plugin that keeps your secrets out of the LLM's context window. API keys, tokens, and passwords live in your OS keychain. The LLM works with placeholders like `{{API_KEY}}` and never sees the actual values.

## How it works

You store a secret in your keychain. Claude references it by name. A wrapper script resolves the real value in a sandboxed subprocess and redacts it from output before Claude reads it back.

On macOS, every bash command Claude runs is wrapped in a Seatbelt sandbox that blocks `com.apple.SecurityServer` at the kernel level. The sandbox denies the Mach IPC call that all keychain access goes through. Doesn't matter how the command is constructed.

## Installation

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add thesaadmirza/blindfold
/plugin install blindfold@blindfold
```

`jq` is required (`brew install jq` / `apt install jq`).

For manual install or other environments, see the [install guide](#manual-install) below.

## Usage

```
> store my gitlab token
# Native password dialog opens. You type the value. Claude sees "OK: stored."

> curl the gitlab API with my token
# Claude runs: secret-exec.sh 'curl -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: {{GITLAB_TOKEN}}" ...'
# Output: PRIVATE-TOKEN: [REDACTED:GITLAB_TOKEN]

> what secrets do I have?
# Lists all secrets by scope, never shows values

> delete my gitlab token
# Removes from keychain and registry
```

## Platforms

| Platform | Secret store | Input dialog |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| macOS | Keychain | osascript / terminal |
| Linux (GUI) | GNOME Keyring / KWallet | zenity / kdialog |
| Linux (headless) | GPG encrypted files | terminal prompt |
| Windows (WSL) | Credential Manager | PowerShell |

Detected automatically. Falls back to terminal prompt when no GUI is available.

## Scoping

Secrets can be global (shared across projects) or project-scoped (tied to a specific directory). A `DATABASE_URL` in your API project is separate from `DATABASE_URL` in your frontend project. Project scope is checked first, global is the fallback.

## Security model

On macOS, a PreToolUse hook wraps every bash command in a Seatbelt sandbox before execution. The sandbox blocks `com.apple.SecurityServer` at the kernel level, which cuts off all keychain access from any process inside it. Python subprocesses, base64-decoded scripts, temp file execution, doesn't matter. The block is below the shell.

`secret-exec.sh` is the only path to secrets. It runs outside the sandbox, reads from the keychain, injects values as prefixed env vars (`__SV_NAME`), then runs the user command inside the sandbox. Output is redacted before Claude sees it. Claude never knows what the prefixed env vars contain because it doesn't know the `__SV_` prefix exists.

Storing a secret goes through a native OS dialog. The value goes from your keyboard to the keychain. Claude sees "OK: stored."

On Linux, the guard hook falls back to string matching since Seatbelt is macOS only.

## Manual install

If `/plugin` isn't available:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thesaadmirza/blindfold.git ~/.claude/skills/blindfold
chmod 700 ~/.claude/skills/blindfold/scripts/*.sh
```

Add hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/blindfold/scripts/secret-guard.sh", "timeout": 5}]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/blindfold/scripts/secret-redact.sh", "timeout": 10}]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Limitations

- On macOS, enforcement is kernel-level via Seatbelt. On Linux, it falls back to string matching which can be bypassed by obfuscating commands.
- `security add-generic-password` on macOS passes the value as a CLI argument, briefly visible in `ps`. Short exposure window.
- The GPG fallback on Linux uses symmetric encryption with a passphrase prompt. `secret-tool` with GNOME Keyring is more secure if available.
- Output redaction is string-based. Secrets shorter than 4 characters won't be redacted.
- If the process is killed with SIGKILL, temp files with secrets may persist in `/tmp/`. Normal termination cleans them up.

## Known Issues

Found during systematic testing of the original Blindfold (commit 12299fa). See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for full methodology and results.

| # | Issue | Severity | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| [#1](https://github.com/MatthewDruhl/blindfold/issues/1) | `secret-list.sh` crashes if `envProfiles` key missing from registry | Low | Script exits with error on valid registries |
| [#2](https://github.com/MatthewDruhl/blindfold/issues/2) | Redact hook reads wrong field — leak detection never fires | **High** | Secrets in command output are never detected or warned about |
| [#3](https://github.com/MatthewDruhl/blindfold/issues/3) | Env file protection bypass — jq `values` bug | **High** | Registered `.env` files can be read freely via Bash and Read tools |

**2 of 3 defense-in-depth security features are broken out of the box.** The guard (blocking direct keychain reads) and secret-exec (placeholder substitution) work correctly.
